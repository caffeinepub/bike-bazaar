## Summary
**Goal:** Convert the 2nd Bike Bajar marketplace into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with founder admin capabilities and automatic role detection.

**Planned changes:**
- Add PWA functionality with web app manifest, service worker, and offline capabilities for home screen installation
- Create About Us/Founder page displaying founder information (Anuj Saha, Bijapur, contact details) with WhatsApp and Instagram links
- Implement automatic role detection in backend to identify founder account (rohitmarpalli@gmail.com) via Internet Identity principal
- Build Founder Admin Panel accessible only to founder for managing all bike listings (view, edit, delete any listing)
- Add founder profile editor in Admin Panel to update name, address, contact, email, and Instagram link
- Extend backend authorization to grant founder admin privileges over all marketplace listings

**User-visible outcome:** Users can install 2nd Bike Bajar as a mobile app on their home screen, view founder information with direct WhatsApp contact, and the founder can manage all marketplace listings through a dedicated admin panel while regular buyers continue using the marketplace normally.
